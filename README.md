# milkyway-idea-plugin
IDEA plugin for visualise Gradle module dependencies as a graph on demand during build.gradle editing.

## Main idea
Mobile developers, when editing build.gradle.kts, specify the dependencies between modules to link them and use the imports/classes of the corresponding connected module.  
Over time, these dependencies become quite deep — so deep that they start affecting the build time of the entire project.  
An Milkyway plugin parses build.gradle.kts and displays a graph of module dependencies in real time.
